# Reset Input Field Button

Input field accepts an input, and displays the contents as a Welcome Message to the visitor. At any point the visitor can reset the input field, however this works only when the field is not empty.

## Why this Project

This project is an assignment solution I made while learning Angular on Udemy.

## What I learnt

1. String Interpolation {{}}
2. Property Binding []="expression"
3. Event Binding ()="expression"
4. 2 way binding using [(ngModel)]
5. $event argument in event binding
